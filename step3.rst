**Read mapping**
------------------

Any standard mapping program such as BWA, Bowtie can be used for this step. We will use Bowtie 1. For short reads (< 50bp), Bowtie 1 is faster and sensitive than Bowtie2.

**Sequencing depth**

Effective analysis of ChIP-seq data requires sufficient coverage by sequence reads (sequencing depth). The required depth depends mainly on the size of the genome and the number and size of the binding sites of the protein. ENCODEâ€™s guidelines is to obtain minimum 10 million uniquely mapping reads per replicate experiment for mammalian genomes (Landt et al, 2009). 

.. note::

  Excercise 2
  
  If atleast 10 million uniquely mapping reads are required for human genome. How many minimum reads are required for E. coli dataset to have sufficent coverage for further analysis?
